                        QUICK START - 5 MINUTES
================================================================================

Your app has been upgraded with permanent data protection.
Follow these 3 simple steps to activate:

================================================================================
                           STEP 1: UPDATE App.js
================================================================================

Open: admin-panel/src/App.js

ADD these imports (near the top with other imports):
```javascript
import AuditLogs from './components/AuditLogs';
import DataRecovery from './components/DataRecovery';
```

ADD these routes (inside your <Routes> section):
```javascript
<Route path="/audit-logs" element={<AuditLogs />} />
<Route path="/data-recovery" element={<DataRecovery />} />
```

TIME: 1 minute

================================================================================
                        STEP 2: UPDATE Sidebar.js
================================================================================

Open: admin-panel/src/components/Sidebar.js

ADD these menu items (in your navigation menu):
```javascript
<NavLink to="/audit-logs">
  📋 Audit Logs
</NavLink>

<NavLink to="/data-recovery">
  🗂️ Data Recovery
</NavLink>
```

TIME: 1 minute

================================================================================
