                    QUICK INTEGRATION GUIDE
================================================================================

STEP 1: Add routes to your App.js
================================================================================

Add these imports at the top:
```javascript
import AuditLogs from './components/AuditLogs';
import DataRecovery from './components/DataRecovery';
```

Add these routes inside your <Routes> element:
```javascript
<Route path="/audit-logs" element={<AuditLogs />} />
<Route path="/data-recovery" element={<DataRecovery />} />
```

STEP 2: Add navigation links to Sidebar.js
================================================================================

Add these menu items to your navigation menu:

```javascript
<NavLink to="/audit-logs" className="nav-item">
  📋 Audit Logs
</NavLink>

<NavLink to="/data-recovery" className="nav-item">
  🗂️ Data Recovery
</NavLink>
```

STEP 3: Update Firebase database.rules.json
================================================================================

Add this rule to prevent audit log deletion:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "auditLogs": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null",
      "$logId": {
        ".delete": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

STEP 4: Verify Installation
================================================================================

1. Login to admin panel
2. Check browser console for "Audit Service initialized" message
3. Check for "Backup Service initialized" message
4. Navigate to /audit-logs (should show audit entries)
5. Navigate to /data-recovery (should be empty initially)

STEP 5: Testing the System
================================================================================

Test Audit Logging:
1. Login to admin panel
2. Go to 📋 Audit Logs
3. Should see ADMIN_LOGIN entry

Test Soft Delete:
1. Delete a customer
2. Go to 🗂️ Data Recovery
3. Should see the customer in deleted list
4. Click restore to bring it back

Test Backup:
1. Make a change to data
2. Check browser's Application > Storage > IndexedDB > AppBackups
3. Should see backup entry with timestamp

================================================================================
                         TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Issue: "Audit Service not initialized" warning
Solution:
- Make sure Login.js has auditService.initialize() call
- Check browser console for errors during login

Issue: Audit logs not showing
Solution:
- Make sure database is accessible
- Check Firebase rules allow reads on auditLogs
- Verify user is logged in with valid auth token

Issue: Recovery showing empty
Solution:
- No items deleted yet (this is good!)
- Try deleting a test customer
- Refresh the recovery page

Issue: Backups not working
Solution:
- Check browser storage quota
- Browser may have limited localStorage
- Try opening DevTools > Storage > IndexedDB
- Verify backupService.initialize() was called
